# JUnit, Mockito and Selenium
## Phase 1—JUnit
Sample Tests and basic functionality.

## Phase 2-Selenium
Used for automation of tasks and tests in SDLC.
Core Concepts
1) WebElement
2) Xpath
3) Locators
4) Selector
5) Waits
6) Listeners
7) Alerts

We are using Selenium IDE extension and WebDriver with Chrome.
Other concepts
1) POM (Page Object Model) is a design pattern commonly used in
 a Selenium web driver for test automation-
   (a) Object Representation-Each web page in your application is modeled as a separate class in your test code.
   (b) Element Identification—Web elements (buttons, text fields, etc.) on a page are represented as variables within the corresponding page class. Locators (id, name, etc.) are used to find these elements.
   (c) Encapsulated Interactions-Methods within the pages class encapsulate actions you can perform on the web elements (actions like click, enter text, etc.).
2) Cross Browser Testing using WebDriver.

## Phase 3-Mockito
Mocking framework for unit tests.
